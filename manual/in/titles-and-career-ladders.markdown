## The Human Element
The vast majority of people I have worked with are interested in career growth. 
Title advancement is a commonly expected way of measuring and communicating 
this development.

## The Business Obligation
The business is best served when we retain talent. Providing guidance and
opportunity for career progression is a central strategy to do so.

## A Humane Approach
To be meaningful, and to avoid bias, the titles awarded to individuals should 
each have:

* Unique and clear [job descriptions](/manual/in/job-descriptions/)
* Objective qualification criteria

The key question I want to be able to answer for staff is, How do I get to the
next level?

Good examples can be found at [CareerLadders.dev](https://career-ladders.dev).
