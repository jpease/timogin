## The Human Element
How do you feel when interviewing for a job? If you're like me, perhaps you 
find the whole task of looking for a job somewhat stressful. The 
recommendations you'll find in this section are designed to help candidates 
perform to their potential. This makes our job easier by providing a more 
consistent basis for assessment.

## The Business Obligation
In my experience, hiring is one of the most strategically critical things we
do. Who we hire shapes the capabilities and culture of our team and company.

Despite its importance, interviewing is sometimes viewed as a nuisance or 
given little preparation. You stop the important work you're doing, get on a 
call and talk. Perhaps you read some provided questions. How hard can it be?

As you probably know, it can be pretty hard. How can we do better? A well 
documented process is a good start. Good documentation makes it easier to train 
all participants involved. But if you want them to be good at it, and you do 
want them to be good at it, that will require coaching. 

A clearly defined process, with staff trained to consistently follow it, allows 
for objectivity and continual improvement.
 
**Legal concerns**  
I'm not qualified to address legal concerns, but they're important. For 
example, below is a link to the US Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission's website. It identifies some topics that cannot be discussed with 
candidates. Other topics, while not prohibited, may be legally problematic. The 
best advice I can provide is to work with your HR and/or legal team to define 
your boundaries, and then regularly verify all interviewers are aware of them.

## Guiding Principles
The suggestions provided here seek to live up to these principles.

**Be respectful**  
Treat candidates with dignity and respect. No explanation should
be needed.

**Eliminate bias**  
Putting aside the legal issues mentioned above, bias (whether conscious or 
unconscious) works against the best interests of the candidate and the company. 
The process should proactively guide participants to an unbiased outcome.

**Move quickly**  
Be prepared to move quickly from initial scheduling to a final decision. A 
slow moving process frustrates candidates and increases the odds that talent 
will be lost to faster moving organizations.

**Over communicate**  
Explain from the start what your overall process looks like. At each step 
remind them where they are now and what they can expect next.
