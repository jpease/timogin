## The Human Element
Many candidates find interviewing to be stressful. This applies both to the
interviews themselves as well as the overall job search. 

## The Business Obligation
Hiring is as a strategic endeavor. Who we hire shapes the
capabilities and culture of our company.

A humane approach will help candidates perform to their 
potential and provide a more accurate basis for assessment.

## Guiding Principles
A hiring process involves multiple people, often spread across teams and 
departments. It's important that all participants follow the process and 
are committed to these principles.

**Be respectful**  
Treat candidates with dignity and respect. No explanation should
be needed.

**Eliminate bias**  
Legal issues aside, bias (whether conscious or unconscious) works against the
best interests of the candidate and the company. The process should proactively
guide participants to an unbiased outcome.

**Move quickly**  
Be preprared to move quickly from initial scheduling to a final decision. A 
slow moving process frustrates candidates and increases the 
odds that talent will be lost to faster moving organizations.

**Over communicate**  
Explain from the start what your overall process looks like. At each step 
remind them where they are now and and what they can expect next.
