## The Human Element
Over the years I've found that many people struggle with self-confidence. While 
this can manifest itself in various ways, it routinely pops up and not only 
among those early in their career. Documented job descriptions help to 
alleviate these concerns by supporting a no-surprises approach to performance 
management. 

## The Business Obligation
An understood job description is the foundation of managing expectations. It 
provides you a starting point for a job listing when hiring. Once hired, it 
forms the basis for discussing performance and role changes. 

## A Humane Approach
Keep your descriptions clear and concise. Identify how this role differs from 
similar roles (e.g. junior level vs senior level).

To set all involved up for success a job description should include:

1. How does this role support overall company goals?
2. What are the qualifications for a person in this role?
3. What is the person responsible for doing? (Think both hard & soft skills)
4. How will performance be evaluated?

**Caution**: It's important that points 2 and 4 above are defined in a way that 
can be objectively measured. If not, bias can sway our judgment or give others 
the impression of it. Whether the bias is real or not, the effects can be 
equally damaging.

**Tip**: I find it useful to schedule regular reviews of job descriptions to maintain 
their accuracy. When job descriptions drift out of alignment with reality it 
can lead to anxiety, confusion, and/or indifference.

  While I linked to the Corporate Controller suite of roles, many others can be
  found here.

  These are most applicable to companies with technical roles.
