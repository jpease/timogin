We don't all see eye to eye. Perhaps the humane treatment of others doesn't 
rank high in your priorities. That self-awareness is important.

A business is not a charity. The management approaches contained in the 
manual are designed to be effective. They will help the people you manage 
perform well over the long-term. **This will make your job easier and make you 
more successful.**

Even if you genuinely don't care about others, it will be better for you if
you manage like you do.
