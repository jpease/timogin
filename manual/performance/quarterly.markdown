## The Human Element
Professional growth, like physical growth, happens gradually. This makes it easy
to miss changes as they occur. Thus, we benefit from regular and intentional
reflection&mdash;the Quarterly Review.

{: .tip}
Foster open dialogue by making the Quarterly Review a **non-threatening
experience**.

How can we achieve a non-threatening experience? We work towards this goal by
structuring it as a **no-surprises event**. Surprises are eliminated when the
review covers topics previously discussed. This means the Quarterly Review is an
extension of our 1on1s. So if we want to conduct effective reviews, then
[consistent meaningful 1on1s](/manual/performance/1on1s) are essential.

Finally, a no-surprises approach means the Quarterly Review is documented and
introduced to new hires as part of the onboarding process. Staff know when it's
coming, why it's done, and what to expect.

## The Business Obligation
**Help people perform to their potential.** We have this responsibility to our
staff and company. The Quarterly Review provides a consistent and
repeatable process to follow through on that obligation.

## A Humane Approach
The recommended process is:

1. Provide staff the questions, asking them to return written answers
3. Prepare by reading and giving thought to their answers
3. Discuss the answers together
4. Document the highlights of the conversation

### The Questions
Prior experiences&mdash;whether professional or personal&mdash;may cause some
to feel apprehensive about sharing candidly. The questions below are carefully
worded to encourage staff to answer in ways that are comfortable to them.

1. What made you feel proud last quarter?
2. Were there enough learning opportunities?
3. What was challenging?
4. What might be challenging next quarter?
5. What excites you about next quarter?

### The Discussion
The five questions above focus on the What. From there you can open up the
discussion to the Why and How. For example, Why do you feel that way? How
can I better help?

As a manager, we have additional topics to prepare. For example, you'll likely
want to review:

* Positive accomplishments and progress
* Any ongoing performance issues
* Upcoming business goals and how they can support those

{: .caution}
Do not delay performance discussions until a Quarterly Review. Instead, have an
ongoing conversation with [feedback given in context](/manual/performance/giving-feedback/#5-deliver-it-in-context).
