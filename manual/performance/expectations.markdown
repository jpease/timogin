Performance measurement is conceptually simple. Does what we are measuring meet
our expectations? If so, we say it performs well. If not, it performs poorly.
**Therefore, setting expectations provides the basis for performance
management.**

For example, let's imagine a student correctly answers five questions on a
ten-question calculus test. Our minimum expectation for a passing grade is six
questions correctly answered. We compare the observed measurement against our
expectations and categorize this score of 50% as a poor performance.

The above measurement is simple to calculate. It also may be woefully inadequate,
which we'll discuss in [Evaluating Performance](/manual/performance/evaluating/).
Nevertheless, expectation setting is a critical first step in performance
management.

## The Human Element

Clear expectations build trust. I believe [trust is the foundation of a positive
culture](/manual/culture/values/). Thus, by setting clear expectations we
provide the basis for performance management and contribute towards a positive
culture. It's all connected.

## The Business Obligation

Our management rightly expects us to measure, monitor, and manage performance.
To do so, we must have defined expectations. Without them, we have no context
to discuss performance. These expectations should be objectively measurable and
connected to business goals your management cares about.

## A Humane Approach

### Defining Expectation

As I work through the process of defining expectations I try to keep the
following three audiences in mind. While listed sequentially, these often
happen in parallel and require multiple iterations.

**Assumptions**. Your management may assume that you'd obviously report on X
even though you didn't mention it. You might assume your staff know that Y will
be expected even though you didn't document it. Ask questions and confirm
understandings.

##### Yourself

Measuring the wrong things will make our job needlessly difficult. So how do we
measure the right things?

* Write down the decision, and resulting action, you are seeking to inform.
* List ideas of what you could observe that would increase your confidence
    making that decision.
* Consider prior art. How have others measured this?

##### Your management

Once I've done my best to identify actionable measurements, I'll discuss with my
manager. It's critical to involve them.

* Do they agree with the approach?
* Is there anything else they want to see reported on?
* Did I miss any angles or context that senior/executive management will consider?

##### Your staff

Good ideas are not unique to management. I'll often discuss these plans with
staff.

* Do they understand and agree with the approach?
* How does their perspective differ?
* How do they think it could be better?

### Communicating Expectations
Communication will help avoid frustration. Here's what I like to do:

* Once an agreement is reached, put it in writing and share it with your
management. Explicit agreement to a mutual understanding helps to avert
misunderstandings later.

* Expectations related to an individual's performance should be communicated
early on in their employment, ideally during their onboarding. Two excellent
places to capture expectations are [job descriptions](/manual/in/job-descriptions/)
and [career ladders](/manual/performance/titles-and-career-ladders/).
