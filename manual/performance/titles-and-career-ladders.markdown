## The Human Element
The vast majority of people I have worked with are interested in career growth.
Title advancement is a commonly expected way of measuring and communicating
this development.

## The Business Obligation
The business is best served when we retain talent. Providing guidance and
opportunity for career progression is a central strategy to do so.

## A Humane Approach
To be meaningful, and to avoid bias, the titles awarded to individuals should
each have:

* Unique and clear [job descriptions](/manual/in/job-descriptions/)
* Objective qualification criteria

The key question I want to be able to answer for staff is, How do I get to the
next level?

## Examples
* [CareerLadders.dev](https://career-ladders.dev){:target="\_blank"}  
  These are most applicable to companies with technical roles.

* [EngineeringLadders.com](http://www.engineeringladders.com/){:target="\_blank"}  
  Another technically focused site. Illustrates the boundaries of expected
  skills, competencies, impact, and relationships within the context of a role's
  level.
