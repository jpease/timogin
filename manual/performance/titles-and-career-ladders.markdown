## The Human Element
The vast majority of people I have worked with are interested in career growth. 
Title advancement is a commonly expected way of measuring and communicating 
this development.

## The Business Obligation
The business is best served when we retain talent. Providing guidance and
opportunity for career progression is a central strategy to do so.

## A Humane Approach
To be meaningful, and to avoid bias, the titles awarded to individuals should 
each have:

* Unique and clear [job descriptions](/manual/in/job-descriptions/)
* Objective qualification criteria

The key question I want to be able to answer for staff is, How do I get to the
next level?

## Examples
* [GitLab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/finance/corporate-controller/){:target="\_blank"}  
  While I linked to the Corporate Controller suite of roles, many others can be
  found here.  

* [CareerLadders.dev](https://career-ladders.dev){:target="\_blank"}  
  These are most applicable to companies with technical roles.

* [EngineeringLadders.com](http://www.engineeringladders.com/){:target="\_blank"}

  Another technically focused site, but illustrates the boundaries of expected skills, competencies, impact, and relationships within the context of a    role's level.
