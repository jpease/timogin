## The Human Element
When good work goes unrecognized, it's demoralizing to the individual. When 
problems are not handled, it's demoralizing to the team. Everyone is better 
off when developments, positive or negative, are identified and responded to 
sooner than later.

## The Business Obligation
There is a saying I like, A short pencil is better than a long memory. You're
probably busy. Our days can become filled with unexpected issues that require 
immediate attention. Despite the best of intentions, performance evaluations 
that don't seem urgent can slip through the cracks. It's our responsibility to 
make sure that doesn't happen.

That's where the pencil comes in. In addition to taking note of things that
need to be addressed, creating and reviewing a monthly checklist can help keep
everything on track.

## A Humane Approach
Here are the questions that I've used to keep a pulse on staff:

* Are they meeting expectations?
  * If not, is there a plan in place and what is its status?
* Are they exceeding expectations? If so:
  * Do they qualify for a salary or [role adjustment](/manual/performance/titles-and-career-ladders/)?
* Are they on the best team or project based on their abilities and goals?
