## The Human Element
You've likely had help along the way in your career. I know I have. The
people on your team need support too.

## The Business Obligation
A successful business is made of strong teams. Strong teams are made of well
supported individuals. A business is right to expect that managers are aware of
how staff are performing and that managers are actively working to make staff
successful.

## A Humane Approach
What you should discuss is dependent upon the needs of the individual. In most
cases, it will vary from week to week.

### Building Trust
For 1on1s to be effective we need to build an environment of trust. I've found
two of the most important things we can do are to **genuinely listen** and
**reliably follow through** on any action items you take on.

In addition, a technique I find valuable is keeping shared notes. My direct
reports can see what I write down about our conversation. I also encourage them
to take note of anything they think of between 1on1s that they'd like to talk
about. This helps us both come to the conversation prepared to get the most out
of it.

for your shared notes.

### Frequency
* **Direct Reports**  
I strongly recommend a weekly 1on1 for all direct reports. If you find a weekly
schedule seems too much, that tends to indicate either too many direct reports
or misguided priorities.

* **Skip Levels**  
The frequency of these will often be dictated by the number of staff in the
team, department, or organization that you are responsible for. The advice I'd
offer is to schedule time each week to hold a few of these. I find they are an
important tool to keep a holistic viewpoint.

### The Standard Questions
**How are you doing?** This simple question is an excellent way to start a 1on1.
But where do you go next? I find these three questions worth asking on a weekly
basis.

* Is there anything you would like to talk about?
* How can I help?
* Do you have any questions for me?

{: .note}
These open-ended questions create an opportunity to find out what is on the
person's mind.  
**Be sure to listen attentively.**

### The Extra Questions
These questions may not be necessary on a weekly basis, but I've found them
valuable to keep a pulse on staff and teams.

* Do you know and understand the team's current obligations and priorities?
* Do you feel there are any blockers preventing you or the team from doing
their best work?
* Are you happy [at the company, on the team, in your role, etc]?
* Have you learned anything new or interesting lately?
* Are you looking for another job?
* How do you feel your team is doing?
  * Does anyone need any extra support?
  * Has anyone been especially helpful?

{: .tip}
You may feel nervous asking some of these questions. Don't let that stop you.  
**These are often the most important**.

### Coaching
For some things in life, showing up is enough. Coaching is not one of those
things. Coaching involves their goals, your goals, and performance issues. At
times two or more of these may overlap, but not always. To help a person realize
positive change requires forethought and preparation specific to that individual.

Here are some questions that can help us prepare.

**Their Goals**
* What goals does this person have?
  * Do they clearly understand the next steps to focus on?

**Your Goals**
* What potential do you see in this individual?
  * What change do you want to see them achieve?

**Performance Issues**
* Are there specific performance improvements that need to occur?
  * Have you made it explicitly clear what those changes are?

**General**
* Where is this person in their professional development?
* What assignments or responsibilities could further their development?
* Does the person have the resources available to make those changes?
  * Does the person know those resources are available?

### The Pitfalls
Here are some traps to be aware of that, if we fall into, largely defeat
the purpose of the 1on1 and leave us with critical blind spots.

1. **The Status Report**  
You (hopefully) have other ways of learning the status of tasks the person is
working on.

2. **The Social Visit**  
There is no need to keep a 1on1 strictly business. In fact, discussing topics
unrelated to work is a great idea. However, don't allow those topics to cause
the business critical items to be rushed or skipped altogether.
