[Culture](/manual/culture/values/) is perhaps the single most powerful lever
we have to influence performance. If you haven't already read that, I suggest
you start there.

The next critical realization is that an individual's ability to perform well
is strongly linked to the systems the company provides them to operate within.
When I see someone struggling I try to remember to ask myself, Where are we
failing this person?

With that said, we need to help people perform well at the individual level.
What follows are approaches others have used successfully. I hope they will
work well for you also.
